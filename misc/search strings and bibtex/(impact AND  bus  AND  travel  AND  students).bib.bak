abstract={The impact factors of the passenger travel choice were made by taking full consideration of the effect of ticket purchase and transfer mode on the passenger mode choice, a travel choice behavior experiment was designed from the perspective of whole trip chain including ticket stage, access stage, travel stage and leave stage. In our analysis, college student travel survey data for bus, tradition train, high-speed train and plane was used to establish the MNL model of passenger travel mode choice. The parameter estimation and elastic analysis of significant factors were made to draw a conclusion. The research showed that the access mode and time were the important factor to affect the passenger travel choice in addition to the monthly income, travel distance and purpose. Improving the accessibility of transportation hub is an important strategy to adjust transportation market share. Moreover, bus is more likely to be chosen by college students who have low monthly income, short travel distance and access time for the purpose to visit relatives. However, subway is more likely to be chosen by college students who have higher monthly income, relatively short travel distance and access time for the purpose of visiting relatives. © 2016, Editorial Office of Journal of Xi'an University of Architecture & Technology.

abstract={Overcrowding has grown to be an increasingly important issue for public transit in Guangzhou, China. To capture traveler benefits of reduced crowding from improved public transport, it is necessary to identify the relevant importance of crowding to travelers. This paper analyzes the disutility of crowding in metro car and bus transit with discrete choice models. Based on the stated preference survey data from college students in Guangzhou, the results show that there is non-negligible impact of crowding on passenger travel. The relationship between the disutility of crowding and standee density is not linear; that is, the disutility increases at a modest rate as the standee density increases when it is easy to move around in cars and increases rapidly when it is difficult to move around in cars. Also, there is only a slight difference between the effects of crowding on metro and bus transit. © 2016, University of South Florida. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Active transport offers opportunities to reduce the environmental impacts of car travel and improve health. During adolescence, friends and parents may influence transport mode to school. Using a social network survey of 934 high school students we investigated whether students' walking, cycling, bus and car travel to school were predicted by their friends' transport behaviour, accounting for parent encouragement, ride availability, distance to school, gender, school unit and age. In addition, we examined whether descriptive norms, friend encouragement or co-travel requests mediated the effect of friends' active transport behaviour. We found that friends' transport behaviour predicted ego behaviour, particularly for cycling. Descriptive norms and co-travel requests, but not friend encouragement, approached significance as mediators of friends' active transport similarities. Parent encouragement for active transport was a particularly strong predictor of transport mode. Implications for future research and interventions are discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Lexington, Kentucky may be poised to join the ranks of U.S. cities looking to Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) as a cost-effective technique to reduce traffic congestion and increase transit ridership. The Transit Authority of Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government's (Lextran) Board of Directors and staff, coordinating with the Lexington Metropolitan Planning Organization (LAMPO), targeted the busy US 27/Nicholasville Road corridor for study by commissioning an Alternatives Analysis (AA). LextranBLUE, as the BRT would be called, would operate with approximately one mile station spacing from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on a 20-minute headway weekdays. It is estimated that the line would initially generate 1,700 riders on an average weekday. When college students and special event trips are accounted for, the number is estimated to increases to 2,100 per weekday. The service is envisioned as a mixed traffic option in which buses would travel in an existing travel lane, most likely the right-most lane. Through the use of GPS technology, Transit Signal Priority (TSP) provides a time savings advantage to BRT buses with minimal impact on overall traffic flows. TSP allows buses to receive additional and/or early green phase indications at the traffic signal when schedule adherence problems are detected. Lextran is currently performing a Comprehensive Operations Analysis and is seeking to validate the need for the service as well as to potentially identify some operational savings from other routes that could potentially be used for on-going operations of the BRT service. Likewise, Lexington Metropolitan Planning Organization (LAMPO) is investigating the potential use of grant monies and other funding sources to cover the capital investments needed to implement LextranBLUE in the Nicholasville Road corridor.},

abstract={Travel Demand Management (TDM) techniques mainly focus on reducing the number of single occupant car trips and encourage people to use more efficient and sustainable modes such as buses, cycles, and walking. Travel plan is being used as a Travel Demand Management tool around the world in recent times. Medium to large organisations have started to develop travel plans for their employees with a view to modifying their travel behaviour. If the commuting behaviour of a large number of employees could be changed through travel plans it could have a huge impact on reducing congestion and road transport related pollution. Universities can attract a large number of trips from the students and staff. On many issues universities act as a role model. If the universities can modify the travel habits of students and staff through travel plans, they can not only have positive effects on the city road network and environment but also encourage other organisations to follow suit. This study critically reviews the travel plans of a few universities around the world from sustainability perspectives. It critiques the basis of adopting policies and attempts to find the common as well as unique features of the measures with a view to identifying the best practices. Travel plans are still a new concept and there are hardly any guidelines on preparing them. This research would help universities to modify or develop effective travel plans and lead others to adopt sustainable practices. © 2014 WIT Press.},

In particular, we incorporated multimodal public transportation networks, including bus networks, to estimate the student commuting routes. The student samples for this study were collected from an online travel diary survey conducted by Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, Japan. The ArcGIS Network Analyst was used to construct spatial network datasets and reconstruct trajectories from the origin-destination trip dataset. In addition, line densities of estimated trajectories were calculated and displayed on maps for geovisualization. These maps helped us understand the precise locations of congestion and spatial patterns of student commuting, unlike linear representations of people's movements that connect origins and destinations. Our study also showed that estimated trajectories can simulate quantitative impacts on travel time by promoting walking or the use of public transportation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={How staff and students travel to university can impact their physical activity level. An online survey of physical activity and travel behaviour was conducted in early November 2012 to inform planning of physical activity and active travel promotion programs at the University of Sydney, Australia as part of the "Sit Less, Move More" sub-committee of the Healthy University Initiative, and as baseline data for evaluation. There were 3,737 useable responses, 60% of which were from students. Four out of five respondents travelled to the University on the day of interest (Tuesday, November 30, 2012). The most frequently used travel modes were train (32%), car as driver (22%), bus (17%), walking (17%) and cycling (6%). Staff were twice as likely to drive as students, and also slightly more likely to use active transport, defined as walking and cycling (26% versus 22%). Overall, 41% of respondents were sufficiently active (defined by meeting physical activity recommendations of 150 min per week). Participants were more likely to meet physical activity recommendations if they travelled actively to the University. With a high proportion of respondents using active travel modes or public transport already, increasing the physical activity levels and increasing the use of sustainable travel modes would mean a mode shift from public transport to walking and cycling for students is needed and a mode shift from driving to public transport or active travel for University staff. Strategies to achieve this are discussed.},

abstract={Trips to school are increasingly taken in automobiles. Smart growth and health advocates suggest that a better-designed built environment in a neighborhood can promote walking and biking to school and that children's walking and biking improve the environment, lower obesity, and increase physical activity. The effects of school variables on travel behavior, however, have rarely been documented. The objective of this research is to examine the impact of school location and characteristics on students' choice of travel mode. The argument is that if the local school is good, then a child is more likely to attend it. The chance increases that the child will commute actively to a school within a short distance, all else equal. School trips from the 2001 Post Census Regional Household Travel Survey of the Los Angeles, California, region were analyzed in relation to school quality in the area of the traveler's origin (residence) and destination. Results revealed that for young travelers who attended kindergarten to sixth grade, school quality and residential environment had no significant effect on nonmotorized modes. In addition, school quality had little impact on mode choice. Nonetheless, the distance from home to the nearest high school significantly increased the probability that students who attended seventh to 12th grades would choose the bus over a private vehicle. A 10% increase in the distance from home to the nearest high school raised the probability of taking the bus by 2.86%, while an identical increase in residential density increased the probability of walking or biking by 1.09%.},

abstract={We explore how school policies influence the environmental impacts of school commutes. Our research is motivated by increased interest in school choice policies (in part because of the U.S. "No Child Left Behind" Act) and in reducing bus service to address recent budget shortfalls. Our analysis employs two samples of elementary-age children, age 5-12: a travel survey (n = 1246 respondents) and a school enrollment data set (n = 19,655 students). Multinomial logistic regression modeled the determinants of travel mode (automobile, school bus, and walking; n = 803 students meeting selection criteria). Travel distance has the single greatest effect on travel mode, though school choice, trip direction (to- or fromschool), and grade play a role. Several policies were investigated quantitatively to predict the impact on school travel, vehicle emissions, and costs. We find that eliminating district-wide school choice (i.e., returning to a system with neighborhood schools only) would have significant impacts on transport modes and emissions, whereas in many cases proposed shifts in school choice and bus-provision policies would have only modest impacts. Policies such as school choice and school siting may conflict with the goal of increasing rates of active (i.e., nonmotorized) school commuting. Policies that curtail bus usage may reduce bus emissions but yield even larger increases in privatevehicle emissions. Our findings underscore the need to critically evaluate transportation-related environmental and health impacts of currently proposed changes in school policy. © 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={This research explores the effect of bus occupancy information on transit users' choice of a bus by use of a binary logit model. The model predicts the probability of bus choice between the first arriving bus and the second arriving bus. The analysis is based on interview survey data obtained over 1 week (June 19 to June 25, 2008) in the Seoul metropolitan area in South Korea. The data reveal that the need for public transportation information varies by user group (white- or blue-collar workers, students, homemakers, self-employed workers, and older people) and the stage of the trip (before a trip, at a stop, on board, and at a transfer point). The results show that the availability of seats will increase the probability that a bus user will choose to board an arriving bus, with all other things being kept constant, whereas the travel time on board and the crowdedness on a bus decrease the probability that a public transit user will choose to board an arriving bus. The effects of bus occupancy information are also different among user groups (white- or blue-collar workers, students, homemakers, self-employed workers, and older people) and trip purpose (commute and noncommute).},

abstract={This paper presents the efforts by Boǧaziçi University, Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute (BU-KOERI), Istanbul Community Impact Project in Istanbul, Turkey in piloting three innovative uses of geospatial information technology for community-participation in disaster mitigation. 1) The Neighborhood Geographic Information Sharing System provided volunteers with skills and tools for identification of seismic risks and response assets in their neighborhoods. Field data collection volunteers used low-cost hand-held computers and data compiled was fed into a geospatial database accessible over the Internet. Interactive thematic maps enabled discussion of mitigation measures and action alternatives. This pilot evolved into a proposal for sustained implementation with local fire stations. 2) The Basic Disaster Awareness Program Monitoring Facility involved collaboration between the Istanbul Community Impact Project and the Istanbul Education Directorate. School Basic Disaster Awareness instructors reported on dissemination of training using a web-based data entry application. The data was used to create a series of interactive Web-based thematic maps showing the geographic reach of the training program with hot links which allow the public to drill down to see local contact information. 3) The School Commute Contingency Pilot was designed to track school-bus routes in Istanbul, in order to stimulate contingency planning for commute-time emergencies when 400,000 students travel an average of 45 minutes each way on 20,000 service buses. Global Positioning System (GPS) data loggers were used to determine service bus routes displayed on printed maps highlighting nearest schools along the route. It is proposed that bus-drivers, parents and school managers be issued route maps with nearest schools that could serve as both meeting places and shelters. The system is designed to be in synchrony with the Istanbul Earthquake Early Warning and Rapid Response System housed at BU-KOERI. © 2005 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},
