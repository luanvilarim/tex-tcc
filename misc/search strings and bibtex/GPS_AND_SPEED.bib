abstract={With modern cycling computers it is possible to provide cyclists with complex feedback during rides. If the feedback is course-dependent, it is necessary to know the riders current position on the course. Different approaches to estimate the position on the course from common GPS and speed sensors were compared: the direct distance measure derived from the number of rotations of the wheel, GPS coordinates projected onto the course trajectory, and a Kalman filter incorporating speed as well as GPS measurements. To quantify the accuracy of the different methods, an experiment was conducted on a race track where a fixed point on the course was tagged during the ride. The Kalman filter approach was able to overcome certain shortcomings of the other two approaches and achieved a mean error of (formula presented) and a root mean square error of (formula presented). © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={Path inference is essential for many location-based services, and it infers vehicle moving paths from noisy and incomplete data captured by GPS devices mounted on vehicles. However, Path inference remains a highly challenging task due to uncertain measurements, dynamic road context and diverse personal preferences of drivers. Existing works usually mapped GPS observations to candidate paths by assuming the same road contexts and the same preference for all drivers, which is unreasonable in practice. To address those issues, we propose a graphical model ConPPI based on conditional random field for path inference, by simultaneously considering both the road average speed which is one of the most important contexts, and the personalized information in a unified model. To exploit these information, ConPPI learns the road average speeds from pair-wise location data and discovers the drivers’ personal preferences collaboratively. Extensive experiments on subsets from a real world dataset show that ConPPI can accurately infer both road average speeds and personal preferences, which leads to better path inference performance when compared with state-of-the-arts techniques. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Map-matching is the process of matching the GPS locus to the road network on the digital map. However, due to the most existing map-matching algorithms that are based on high sampling rate, when the sampling interval is increased, the correct rate of the algorithm will be greatly reduced. Based on this, this paper proposed a new algorithm of map-matching for low sampling rate GPS trajectories. The algorithm gave full consideration to the road network of the geometric structure and topological structure and the mutual influence between adjacent points (time, speed information) by calculating the probability of each trajectory point of candidate points to determine matching results. At the end of this paper, we use the data of Beijing UCAR Inc.’s car in a case study. This case demonstrates: For low sampling rate matching track points in the complex road, the algorithm has a good uptime, and an exact match was found. © 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract={Providing guidance and information to drivers to help them make fuel-efficient route choices remains an important and effective strategy in the near term to reduce fuel consumption from the transportation sector. One key component in implementing this strategy is a fuel-consumption estimation model. In this paper, we developed a mesoscopic fuel consumption estimation model that can be implemented into an eco-routing system. Our proposed model presents a framework that utilizes large-scale, real-world driving data, clusters road links by free-flow speed and fits one statistical model for each of cluster. This model includes predicting variables that were rarely or never considered before, such as free-flow speed and number of lanes. We applied the model to a real-world driving data set based on a global positioning system travel survey in the Philadelphia-Camden-Trenton metropolitan area. Results from the statistical analyses indicate that the independent variables we chose influence the fuel consumption rates of vehicles. But the magnitude and direction of the influences are dependent on the type of road links, specifically free-flow speeds of links. A statistical diagnostic is conducted to ensure the validity of the models and results. Although the real-world driving data we used to develop statistical relationships are specific to one region, the framework we developed can be easily adjusted and used to explore the fuel consumption relationship in other regions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Distributed computation of average consensus is an important function in numerous wireless sensor networks and ad-hoc networks applications. In light of the severe resource constraints characterizing these embedded networked systems, it is of paramount importance the design of effective algorithms with low computational, communication, and energy requirements. Randomized gossip are a category of network algorithms that entail communication and information exchange among nodes selected with probabilistic mechanisms. They are considered attractive solutions for solving consensus problems because of their decentralized nature, conceptual simplicity, and capability of adapting to structural network modifications. However, the number of iterations needed by randomized gossip to converge towards consensus is an issue to be addressed to reduce latency and to limit the impact of the algorithm on the lifetime of battery operated devices. Solutions to the problem have been proposed that make use of localization and greedy geographic routing to build overlay graphs on top of a randomized gossip protocol, thus enabling information averaging among non-neighbor nodes and accelerating convergence. The main drawback of this type of approach is that each node is required to know its position, which is not always affordable in terms of costs or not even possible because of the lack of GPS signal. In this article we propose a novel approach to the consensus averaging problem based on a random walk mechanism to identify nodes involved in a computation round, and on a path averaging technique to update more than two nodes into the same round. The resulting algorithm doesn’t rely on any positioning mechanism. Experimental results provide evidence of the improved performance of the proposed method with respect to standard randomized gossip, with considerable gain in terms of convergence speed. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Safety issues while driving in smart cities are considered to be top-notch priority in contrast to traveling. Today's fast paced society, often leads to accidents. In order to reduce the road accidents, one key area of research is monitoring the driving behavior of drivers. Understanding the driver behavior is an essential component in Intelligent Driver Assistance Systems. One of potential cause of traffic fatalities is aggressive driving behavior. However, drivers are not fully aware of their aggressive actions. So, in order to increase awareness and to promote driver safety, a novel system has been proposed. In this work, we focus on DTW based event detection technique, which have not been researched in motion sensors based time series data to a great extent. Our motivation is to improve the classification accuracy to detect sudden braking and aggressive driving behaviors using sensory data collected from smartphone. A very significant feature of DTW is to be able to automatically cope with time deformations and different speeds associated with time-dependent data which makes it suitable for our chosen application where data might get affected due to factors such as: high variability in road and vehicle conditions, heterogeneous smartphone sensors, etc. Our technique is novel as it uses fusion of sensors to enhance detection accuracy. The experimental results show that proposed algorithm outperforms the existing machine learning and threshold-based techniques with 100% detection rate of braking events and 97% & 86.67% detection rate of normal left & right turns and aggressive left & right turns respectively. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Connected vehicle (CV) technology allows developing next-generation transit signal priority (TSP) that is based on cooperation between signals (change signal timing) and buses (alter speed). In this study, a CV-based TSP that was previously developed and evaluated through a computer simulation was tested in the field. The field experiment at the Smart Road testbed at the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (Blacksburg, Virginia) validated the feasibility of CV-based TSP and evaluated its performance. The proposed TSP algorithm properly delivered TSP green times to buses with a 100% success rate. In addition, it reduced delays-between 32 and 75%-for a bus traveling approximately 72.4 km=h (45 mi=h) and a traffic signal with a 90-s cycle length with 30-s green time. Moreover, the field experiment showed that regular and differential global positioning system (GPS) devices demonstrate no statistically significant difference in performance. This finding could facilitate large-scale implementation of the TSP logic based on connected vehicle technology (TSPCV) because the regular GPS devices are readily available and much cheaper than differential GPS devices. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={Driving behavior is generally considered to be one of the most important factors in crash occurrence. This paper aims to evaluate the benefits of utilizing context-relevant information in the driving behavior assessment process (i.e. contextual driving behavior assessment approach). We use a Bayesian Network (BN) model that investigates the relationships between GPS driving observations, individual driving behavior, individual driving risks, and individual crash frequency. In contrast to prior studies without context information (i.e. non-contextual approach), the data used in the BN approach is a combination of contextual features in the surrounding environment that may contribute to crash risk, such as road conditions surrounding the vehicle of interest and dynamic traffic flow information, as well as the non-contextual data such as instantaneous driving speed and the acceleration/deceleration of a vehicle. An information-aggregation mechanism is developed to aggregates massive amounts of vehicle GPS data points, kinematic events and context information into drivel-level data. With the proposed model, driving behavior risks for drivers is assessed and the relationship between contextual driving behavior and crash occurrence is established. The analysis results in the case study section show that the contextual model has significantly better performance than the non-contextual model, and that drivers who drive at a speed faster than others or much slower than the speed limit at the ramp, and with more rapid acceleration or deceleration on freeways are more likely to be involved in crash events. In addition, younger drivers, and female drivers with higher VMT are found to have higher crash risk. © 2017},

The localisation was many years used only for outdoor purposes such as navigation. However, we start to use it also for optimisation methods, staff efficiency evaluation, industrial management and many other areas. Therefore, the indoor localisation starts to take a significant part in these areas. This paper provides evaluation measurements of different localisation techniques for outdoor as well as for indoor (Wi-Fi, cellular and GPS). We use the standard android device (Smartphone) for evaluating these techniques in accuracy, speed and others. This allows a basic evaluation of these methods, which might be used for future development of optimal indoor and outdoor localisation methods. We show that more complex applications demand much more complex system for localisation as i.e. combination of above-mentioned techniques. © 2017 Concern CSRI Elektropribor, JSC.},
