abstract={Recent research showed that human mobility is characterized by reproducible patterns, i.e., humans tend to travel a few known places. Timely identification of these significant journeys has prospects for emerging intelligent applications like real-time traffic route recommendation and automated HVAC systems. Existing mobile systems, however, utilize energy-hungry sensors like GPS and gyroscope to detect significant journeys, which make it hard to keep such systems running to continuously monitor driving routes. To address this issue of energy efficiency without compromising the performance, in this paper, a hybrid mobile system based on the barometer sensor of a smartphone is developed. Distinctive elevation signatures of driving routes are captured using the smartphone barometer sensor that is exceptionally energy-efficient and position/orientation-independent. Degraded accuracy due to flat areas with minimal elevation changes is offset by developing an adaptive algorithm that opportunistically obtains GPS locations for a very short period of time when such flat areas are detected in real time. Using over 150 miles of field data, it is demonstrated that the proposed mobile system achieves the mean detection accuracy of 97% with the mean false positive rates of 1.5%. © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Congestion is a dynamic phenomenon with elements of space and time, making it a promising application of probe vehicles. The purpose of this paper is to measure and visualize the magnitude and variability of congestion on the network scale using smartphone GPS travel data. The sample of data collected in Quebec City contained over 4000 drivers and 21,000 trips. The congestion index (CI) was calculated at the link level for each hour of the peak period and congestion was visualized at aggregate and disaggregate levels. Results showed that each peak period can be viewed as having an onset period and dissipation period lasting one hour. Congestion in the evening is greater and more dispersed than in the morning. Motorways, arterials, and collectors contribute most to peak period congestion, while residential links contribute little. Further analysis of the CI data is required for practical implementation in network planning or congestion remediation. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group},

abstract={We propose and compare combinations of several methods for classifying transportation activity data from smartphone GPS and accelerometer sensors. We have two main objectives. First, we aim to classify our data as accurately as possible. Second, we aim to reduce the dimensionality of the data as much as possible in order to reduce the computational burden of the classification. We combine dimension reduction and classification algorithms and compare them with a metric that balances accuracy and dimensionality. In doing so, we develop a classification algorithm that accurately classifies five different modes of transportation (i.e., walking, biking, car, bus and rail) while being computationally simple enough to run on a typical smartphone. Further, we use data that required no behavioral changes from the smartphone users to collect. Our best classification model uses the random forest algorithm to achieve 96.8% accuracy. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Traditionally, departments of transportation (DOTs) have dispatched probe vehicles with dedicated vehicles and drivers for monitoring traffic conditions. Emerging assisted GPS (AGPS) and accelerometer-equipped smartphones offer new sources of raw data that arise from voluntarily-traveling smartphone users provided that their modes of transportation can correctly be identified. By introducing additional raster map layers that indicate the availability of each mode, it is possible to enhance the accuracy of mode detection results. Even in its simplest form, an artificial neural network (ANN) excels at pattern recognition with a relatively short processing timeframe once it is properly trained, which is suitable for real-time mode identification purposes. Dubai is one of the major cities in the Middle East and offers unique environments, such as a high density of extremely high-rise buildings that may introduce multi-path errors with GPS signals. This paper develops real-time mode identification ANNs enhanced with proposed mode availability geographic information system (GIS) layers, firstly for a universal mode detection and, secondly for an auto mode detection for the particular intelligent transportation system (ITS) application of traffic monitoring, and compares the results with existing approaches. It is found that ANN-based real-time mode identification, enhanced by mode availability GIS layers, significantly outperforms the existing methods. © 2017 by the authors.},

abstract={The new technological approaches in the last several years bring new possibilities for many different areas, i.e. localisation. The localisation was many years used only for outdoor purposes such as navigation. However, we start to use it also for optimisation methods, staff efficiency evaluation, industrial management and many other areas. Therefore, the indoor localisation starts to take a significant part in these areas. This paper provides evaluation measurements of different localisation techniques for outdoor as well as for indoor (Wi-Fi, cellular and GPS). We use the standard android device (Smartphone) for evaluating these techniques in accuracy, speed and others. This allows a basic evaluation of these methods, which might be used for future development of optimal indoor and outdoor localisation methods. We show that more complex applications demand much more complex system for localisation as i.e. combination of above-mentioned techniques. © 2017 Concern CSRI Elektropribor, JSC.},

abstract={This paper demonstrates a new cooperative bus location system with BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) devices and smartphones. Our idea has extended common participatory sensing systems to realize more practical sensing systems because common participatory sensing mechanisms require a participants' operation to measure some values. Our proposed system consists of a BLE devices on a bus, smartphone applications on a participants' smartphone, and a cloud service. The BLE device has a GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver and a communication function based on the BLE specification. The BLE device also activates a neighbor smartphone application by transmitting a special beacon message. Hence, the smartphone application can work and obtain the bus location from BLE device even if it was a suspended status. Additionally, it also uploads the bus location to the cloud service automatically. As a result, the proposed system can collect a bus location from BLE devices through smartphones automatically. The demonstration shows a prototype system based on the proposed idea for a bus location system. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Usage-based Insurance (UBI) is regarded as a promising way to offer more accurate insurance premium by profiling driving behaviors. Compared with traditional insurance which considers drivers' history of accidents, traffic violations and etc, UBI focuses on driving data and can give a more reasonable insurance premium based on the current driving behaviors. Insurers use sensors in smartphone or vehicle to collect driving data (e.g. mileage, speed, hark braking) and compute a risk score based on these data to recalculate insurance premium. Many insurance programs, which are advertised as being privacy-preserving, do not directly use the GPS-based tracking, but it is not enough to protect driver's location privacy. In real world, many environment factors such as real-time traffic and traffic regulations can influence driving speed. These factors provide the side-channel information about the driving route, which can be exploited to infer the vehicle's trace. Based on the observation, we propose a novel speed based trajectory inference algorithm which can track drivers only with the speed data and original location. We implement the attack on a public dataset in New Jersey. The evaluation results show that the attacker can recover the route with a high successful rate. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={It is important to develop pedestrians, convenience and safety for realizing ITS world. In recent years, navigation for pedestrians has been increased by spreading of smart phones. The GPS (Global Positioning System) is main stream to obtain user's position information outdoors. However, positioning quality is poor in urban area. Then, the positioning reliability becomes worse. We can point out the following two problems. Firstly, the position information is shown on the sidewalk on the opposite side where the user is present although he does not cross the roadway. Secondly, despite the fact that he is not moving, the position information is shown as if the user is moving. Our purpose is to improve the above two problems. In this paper, we will propose two methods to estimate pedestrian's behaviors on roads. One is to estimate the time of starting road crossing. Another is to estimate pedestrian's state, that is moving or stopping. In this paper, we assume that the pedestrians is on the sidewalk of roads. Then, we will use a magnetic field sensor on the smartphone in order to estimate the above two pedestrian's behaviors. And we will show the ability of the both methods. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Monitoring the road condition has acquired a critical significance during recent years.

C4.5 Decision tree classifier is applied on training data to classify road segments and to build our model. Our experimental results show consistent accuracy of 98.6%. Using this approach, we expect to visualize a road quality map of a selected region. Hence, we can provide constructive feedback to drivers and local authorities.

We present a model to estimate CO2 emissions from passenger cars on basis of GPS and accelerometer data gathered from the driver's or passengers' smartphone apps. As part of an experiment to establish ground truth, a method for measuring fuel consumption without instrumenting vehicles is presented. As part of this estimation model, a method for discerning between different driving modes (idle, accelerating, cruising and turning) is presented, using the K-means clustering method. This method will increase the accuracy of the emission model by estimating the fuel consumption while accelerating and braking, as well as estimate idle consumption. The model will enable a more detailed emission inventory, both in terms of location and time. Apart from emission of CO2, the method can also be used for estimation of other transport related emissions. The detailed localised emissions can be used to monitor air quality in an area in near real-time as well as help in creating precise emission data for green accounting. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={A vehicle's fuel consumption is strongly related to both its loading and the driver's driving behavior, such as aggressive/tender acceleration, improper/proper gear change or running/stopping the engine while waiting. This paper introduces EasyRoute, an economical route recommendation system for modern vehicles, implemented in smartphones, to improve fuel efficiency. EasyRoute senses the vehicle's fuel consumption through the On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) adapter and then models the driver's personal fuel consumption according to OBD data from two aspects: i) when the vehicle is moving and ii) when the vehicle is idling or waiting. Based on the crowdsourced traffic information, EasyRoute can near-correctly predict total fuel consumptions of different routes and recommend drivers with the greenest route. We describe the EasyRoute framework and evaluate it by collecting OBD and GPS data from 559 taxis in Beijing. Comparing with some commonly used baselines with error metrics, the experimental results show that using a small 10-minute dataset for training, the total fuel consumption estimated by EasyRoute has a relative error of at least 30% less than the baselines. © 2016 IEEE.},

The proposed drift-reduction method in UTMLS addresses the cumulating error issue in the indoor tracking with the consumer grade motion sensor. The proposed hypothesis test method in UTMLS improves the tracking sensor fusion precision by detecting distorted GPS reports and intelligently switching between GPS and inertial sensor based schemes. The proposed scheme is instantiated and implemented on an Android smartphone platform. Experiments have been conducted to evaluate and validate the accuracy. Experimental results show that 1) the proposed drift-reduction method effectively suppresses the non-GPS tracking error accumulation due to the integration of acceleration noise with time 2) UTMLS realizes robust indoor/outdoor seamless tracking, preventing GPS fault estimates introduced tracking error in the conventional Kalman filtering process. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Rash driving is one of the primary reasons for road fatalities. However, the existing literature seldom talks about precise quantitative measures to assess behaviors like rash driving during traffic analytics. Moreover, the subjective factors like broken road patches, high peak bumps (or some time known as speed breakers in some countries), poor night illumination etc. have not been taken into consideration in the existing driver rating systems. This paper develops a methodology for fair and effective driver rating using a dynamic time warp (DTW) method, based on their behavioral observations as captured by smartphone sensors (GPS, accelerometer, light sensor etc.). The value of the correlation coefficient between the system rating and a manual rating is found to be more than 70% for our proposed system, SafeDrive, when tested extensively for bumps along a 7km city road patch. The system can be extended to provide a comprehensive driving score by including other road features like pot holes, sharp turns etc., in addition to bumps. © 2017 IEEE.},

To evaluate the proposed framework, a series of driving experiments are conducted in both controlled and “free-driving” conditions. In all experiments, the smartphone can be freely positioned inside the subject vehicle.

abstract={In urban canyon where the GNSS signals are blocked by buildings, the accuracy of measured position significantly deteriorates. GIS databases have been frequently utilized to improve the accuracy of measured position using map matching approaches. In map matching, the measured position is projected to the road links (centerlines) in this approach and the lateral error of measured position is reduced. By the advancement in data acquision approaches, high definition maps which contain extra information, such as road lanes are generated. These road lanes can be utilized to mitigate the positional error and improve the accuracy in position. In this paper, the image content of a camera mounted on the platform is utilized to detect the road boundaries in the image. We apply color masks to detect the road marks, apply the Hough transform to fit lines to the left and right road boundaries, find the corresponding road segment in GIS database, estimate the homography transformation between the global and image coordinates of the road boundaries, and estimate the camera pose with respect to the global coordinate system. The proposed approach is evaluated on a benchmark. The position is measured by a smartphone's GPS receiver, images are taken from smartphone's camera and the ground truth is provided by using Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) technique. Results show the proposed approach significantly improves the accuracy of measured GPS position. The error in measured GPS position with average and standard deviation of 11.323 and 11.418 meters is reduced to the error in estimated postion with average and standard deviation of 6.725 and 5.899 meters.},

abstract={Smartphones have revolutionized the way infrastructure health monitoring applications operate. Their ubiquitous sensing and communication capabilities have made measurement data for infrastructural health monitoring applications easily available. They, however, also introduced a new challenge, namely the huge amount of data that is generated. This new reality prompts the need for efficient techniques to handle, process, aggregate, and visualize this huge amount of streaming data. Continuous monitoring of transport infrastructures using crowd-sensing is a new concept being inspired by the power of active participation and contribution of the general public in provision of real-time measurement data about infrastructure characteristic. Even though, accuracy of smartphone's GPS is usually quite acceptable, the accumulated error can lead to large deviations, especially in presence of high speed. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for map matching of crowd-sourced measurements for monitoring ground transportation infrastructures to alleviate the impact of GPS inaccuracies for continuous monitoring of transport infrastructures using smartphones. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Maintenance of ever-expanding road networks all over the world is a critical task and regular monitoring of the road surface is imperative for successful maintenance. Existing monitoring techniques use dedicated vehicles equipped with sensors. Limited availability of these specialized vehicles makes regular monitoring very challenging. This paper explores a novel approach of empowering the smartphone user community for monitoring roads that they use. Smartphones are used for sensing the road surface conditions from a moving vehicle. The system involves client applications on smartphones that collect accelerations as the users travel on the roads, processing of the information and communication to a central server, georeference database, and visualization of road conditions on Google maps. In this paper, the fuzzy logic-based road surface roughness classification is proposed for monitoring the road roughness. The implementation has been demonstrated in different road networks at northern region of India.

abstract={With the improvement of smartphone hardware performance and the development of the MEMS sensor technology, most of the existing mid-and high-end smartphone platforms have installed the consumer micro inertial measurement unit. Combined with GPS receiver, it is easy to obtain the information of position and velocity and realize continuous positioning. Due to the low precision of the consumer MEMS inertial sensor module in the intelligent mobile phone platform, it is difficult to meet the requirements of the vehicle navigation algorithm. In addition, the vehicle will inevitably go through the elevated, tunnels or other specific path in the running process, thus the GPS signal could be blocked and cannot work under these circumstances. To solve these problems, a DR/GPS integrated navigation scheme applicable for smartphone platform is designed based on the vehicle kinematical model. The results of road tests show that the designed method can effectively restrain the error divergence of the pure DR algorithm in the absence of GPS positioning information, and realize continuous accurate positioning. This method has the important engineering application value. © 2017, Editorial Department of Journal of Chinese Inertial Technology. All right reserved.},

abstract={Over the recent years, the popularity of smartphones has increased dramatically. The advanced integrated technology in smartphones like GPS, high-speed CPU, a real world coloured display, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth etc. All these within small size light weight device attracts people a lot to obtain them. The stated capacities of those components motivate developers to create millions of useful applications. However, smartphone devices are energy constraint as they rely on limited battery power supply that has not been increased at the same pace to support the power demands. As both the hardware and the software tend to drain the battery power, the demand for energy efficient applications has increased to keep the mobile devices useful. Optimization related to memory data access create significant difference to performance and power consumption of broad range of dataintensive application. Memory Data layout transformation represents a very interesting class of optimizations. Transform Array of Structure (AOS) to Structure of Array (SOA) is one of the commonly applied and recognized transformation. The transformation reduces the memory access count and subsequently reduces the memory access energy. Thereby, we introduce data layout transformation service as solution to minimize the power consumed by application. The Service will convert the data layout in memory from AOS to SOA. The conversion will reduce the power consumed by memory and processor. Eventually, result in efficient and extended battery life. © 2017 Global IT Research Institute - GiRI.},

abstract={With the embedded sensors - typically Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) and GPS, the smartphone could be leveraged as a low-cost sensing platform for estimating vehicle dynamics. However, the orientation and relative movement of the smartphone inside the vehicle yields the main challenge for platform deployment. This study proposes a solution of converting the smartphone-referenced IMU readings into vehicle-referenced accelerations, which allows free-positioned smartphone for the in-vehicle dynamics sensing. The approach is consisted of (i) geometry coordinate transformation techniques, (ii) neural networks regression of IMU from GPS, and (iii) adaptive filtering processes. Experiment is conducted in three driving environments which cover high occurrence of vehicle dynamic movements in lateral, longitudinal, and vertical directions. The processing effectiveness at five typical positions (three fixed and two flexible) are examined. Results are quantified as the normalized cross-correlation ratio, comparing a free-positioned device against a well-aligned device. The conversion of vertical acceleration is more successful, whereas the lateral and longitudinal accelerations processing outputs may vary. The coordinate transformation completes the most conversion process, and regression and filtering make additional adjustment. After discussion, a final implementation processing pipeline is suggested for the deployment of real-time system. Copyright © 2017 SAE International.},

Thus, an efficient system for mapping road anomalies can significantly promote the safety of drivers and pedestrians. This paper proposes a novel road anomaly mapping system that is able to detect a wide variety of conditions with high accuracy. The smartphone's accelerometer and GPS sensors are used for detection to minimize infrastructure costs. In addition, to ensure the system is adaptive to different road conditions, pattern recognition techniques are used to automatically calculate the detection threshold. Furthermore, to compensate for GPS inaccuracies, reinforcement learning based on a proposed reward system is used to maximize confidence in the detected anomalies. The reward system is also able to forget anomalies that have been fixed. Moreover, the system is implemented in a distributed way between the smartphone and a cloud server to minimize cellular bandwidth usage, while still retaining the accuracy advantages of a centralized cloud. Live tests have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the system and the results show it is accurate under different driving conditions. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={We implement a collision prevention system, called pSafety, which instantaneously informs pedestrians and drivers of the potential threatening accidents. Unlike other systems, pSafety alerts pedestrians of threatening vehicles coming from not only the line-of-sight, but also non-line-of-sight due to obstructions of the wall corner or other vehicles. pSafety collects GPS information from smartphones of pedestrians and vehicle drivers through mobile networks. The main challenge of pSafety is that current smartphones demonstrate larger distance errors on the order of a few meters due to its intrinsic low-cost GPS receivers. To address the impact of large-error positioning to pSafety, we regard each participant on the map as a sector that indicates a predicted location. We subsequently design the Sector Overlap Detection Algorithm, called SODA, to detect whether two sectors are overlapping in time (1). To avoid warning fatigue, we additionally provide a threat ranking method to evaluate the degree of risk for each potential collision event. Through our designed App, pedestrians and drivers both could receive a clear view of potential risks and then take proper actions to avoid accidents. In our implementation, we show that pSafety rapidly informs participants (i.e., pedestrians and drivers) and provides each participant a sufficient response time to avoid collision. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The potential of geospatial big data has been drawing attention for a few years. Despite the larger and larger market penetration of portable technologies (nomadic and wearable devices like smartphones and smartwatches), their opportunities for travel behavior analysis are still relatively unexplored. The main objective of our study is to extract the human mobility patterns from GPS traces in order to derive an indicator for enhancing Collaborative Mobility (CM) between individuals. The first step, extracting activity duration and location, is done using state-of-the-art automated recognition tools. Sensors data are used to reconstruct individual's activity location and duration across time. For constructing the indicator, in a second step, we defined different variables and methods for specific case studies. Smartphone sensor data are being collected from a limited number of individuals and for one week. These data are used to evaluate the proposed indicator. Based on the value of the indicator, we analyzed the potential for identifying CM among groups of users, such as sharing traveling resources (e.g., carpooling, ridesharing, parking sharing) and time (rescheduling and reordering activities). © 2017 by the authors.},

Using the sensors of a smartphone, SmartRoadSense monitors the vertical accelerations inside a vehicle traveling the road and extracts a roughness index conveying information about the road conditions. The roughness index and the smartphone GPS data are periodically sent to a central server where they are processed, associated with the specific road, and aggregated with data measured by other smartphones. This paper studies how the smartphone vertical accelerations and the roughness index are related to the vehicle speed. It is shown that the dependence can be locally approximated with a gamma (power) law. Extensive experimental results using data extracted from SmartRoadSense database confirm the gamma law relationship between the roughness index and the vehicle speed. The gamma law is then used for improving the SmartRoadSense data aggregation accounting for the effect of vehicle speed. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Urban areas in North American cities with positive trends in bicycle usage also witness a high number of cyclist injuries every year. Previous cyclist safety studies based on the traditional approach, which relies on historical crash data, are known to have some limitations such as the fact that crashes need to happen (a reactive approach). This paper explores the use of GPS deceleration events as a surrogate-proactive measure and investigates the relationship between reported cyclist road injuries and deceleration events. The surrogate safety measure is defined based on deceleration values representing hard breaking situations. This work uses a large sample of GPS cyclist trip data from a smartphone application to extract deceleration rates at intersections and along segments and to explore its relationship with the number of observed injuries and validate deceleration rate (DR) as a surrogate safety measure. Using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, we compared the ranking of sites based on the expected number of injuries and based on DR. The ranks of expected injuries and dangerous decelerations were found to have a correlation of 0.60 at signalized intersections, 0.53 at non-signalized intersections and 0.57 at segments. Despite the promising results of this study, more granular data and validation work needs to be done to improve the reliability of the measures. The technological limitations and future work are discussed at the end of the paper. © 2016},

abstract={Android operating system has become one of the most popular smartphone platforms. One report stated that the most important issue of smartphones was its power consumption. Android has a function with which an application can be invoked in screen-off state without user's operation. Some applications frequently work in screen-off state, heavily and consume battery. For saving power consumption in the state, accurate estimation of power consumption of each application is important. However, estimating power consumption cannot be easily achieved because of its dependency on device. That is, application's power consumption varies on installed application and type of hardware module in the device, which can be called software and hardware dependency, respectively. In this paper, we discuss estimation of power consumption in screen-off state considering software dependency. First, we explain software dependency of power consumption. Second, we propose a method, which takes account of software dependency, for estimating power consumption due to GPS. The proposed method monitors GPS utilization individually. Third, we evaluate our method with a benchmark and practical applications using GPS. We then demonstrate that our method can estimate power consumption of each application and suitably predict consumption after uninstalling an application without uninstallation. © 2017 ACM.},
