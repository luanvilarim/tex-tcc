abstract={The human mobility patterns have drew much attention from researchers for decades, considering about its importance for urban planning and traffic management. In this study, the taxi GPS trajectories, smart card transaction data of subway and bus from Beijing are utilized to model human mobility in space. The original datasets are cleaned and processed to attain the displacement of each trip according to the origin and destination locations. Then, the Akaike information criterion is adopted to screen out the best fitting distribution for each mode from candidate ones. The results indicate that displacements of taxi trips follow the exponential distribution. Besides, the exponential distribution also fits displacements of bus trips well. However, their exponents are significantly different. Displacements of subway trips show great specialties and can be well fitted by the gamma distribution. It is obvious that human mobility of each mode is different. To explore the overall human mobility, the three datasets are mixed up to form a fusion dataset according to the annual ridership proportions. Finally, the fusion displacements follow the power-law distribution with an exponential cutoff. It is innovative to combine different transportation modes to model human mobility in the city. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={We propose and compare combinations of several methods for classifying transportation activity data from smartphone GPS and accelerometer sensors. We have two main objectives. First, we aim to classify our data as accurately as possible. Second, we aim to reduce the dimensionality of the data as much as possible in order to reduce the computational burden of the classification. We combine dimension reduction and classification algorithms and compare them with a metric that balances accuracy and dimensionality. In doing so, we develop a classification algorithm that accurately classifies five different modes of transportation (i.e., walking, biking, car, bus and rail) while being computationally simple enough to run on a typical smartphone. Further, we use data that required no behavioral changes from the smartphone users to collect. Our best classification model uses the random forest algorithm to achieve 96.8% accuracy. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={For the simulation of public transport, next to a schedule, knowledge of the public transport routes is required. While the schedules are becoming available, the precise network routes often remain unknown and must be reconstructed. For large-scale networks, however, a manual reconstruction becomes unfeasible. This paper presents a route reconstruction algorithm, which requires only the sequence and positions of the public transport stops and the street network. It uses an abstract graph to calculate the least-cost path from a route's first to its last stop, with the constraint that the path must contain a so-called link candidate for every stop of the route's stop sequence. The proposed algorithm is implemented explicitly for large-scale, real life networks. The algorithm is able to handle multiple lines and modes, to combine them at the same stop location (e.g., train and bus lines coming together at a train station), to automatically reconstruct missing links in the network, and to provide intelligent and efficient feedback if apparent errors occur. GPS or OSM tracks of the lines can be used to improve results, if available. The open-source algorithm has been tested for Zurich for mapping accuracy. In summary, the new algorithm and its MATSim-based implementation is a powerful, tested tool to reconstruct public transport network routes for large-scale systems. © 2017 by the Author.},

abstract={The past few years have witnessed the rapid growth in the collection of large-scale GPS data via smartphone-based travel surveys around the world, following which transportation modes detection received significant attention. A mass of methods varying from Criteria-based rules to Machine Learning technology were employed to recognize the travel modes. However, the limited sample size, deficient feature selection and the less emphasis on addressing confusion modes, which leave room for improvement. This paper therefore sought to develop and evaluate a Random Forest classifier combined with a rule-based method to detect six travel modes (subway, walking, bicycle, e-bike, bus and car). Seven GPS-related variables are selected as feature set from the initial list of 22 variables. Consequently, more than 98&#x0025; subway trips were correctly identified and the overall accuracy of the rest five modes classification is obtained as high as 93.11&#x0025;. More than 85&#x0025; trips were successfully identified for each mode except for the bus. More importantly, results show that socioeconomic attributes data could significantly improve the prediction of e-bike and address the confusion between bus and car modes. The employment of ROC curve provides a statistical proof to the excellent classification capacity of Random Forest in this study. Besides, the comparison with two representative classifiers demonstrates the applicability of Random Forest classifier for travel modes detection incorporating multi-source attributes. IEEE},

abstract={We advocate for and introduce TRANSense, a framework for urban transportation service analytics that combines participatory smartphone sensing data with city-scale transportation-related transactional data (taxis, trains etc.). Our work is driven by the observed limitations of using each data type in isolation: (a) commonly-used anonymous city-scale datasets (such as taxi bookings and GPS trajectories) provide insights into the aggregate behavior of transport infrastructure, but fail to reveal individual-specific transport experiences (e.g., wait times in taxi queues); while (b) mobile sensing data can capture individual-specific commuting-related activities, but suffers from accuracy and energy overhead challenges due to usage artefacts and lack of appropriate sensing triggers. TRANSense demonstrates how a judicious fusion of such disparate data sources can overcome these challenges and offer novel insights. We detail two examples: (a) Taxi Service Analyzer that provides accurate detection of commuter queuing for taxis and estimates their wait time, by using taxi trip records to identify potential taxi locations with high demand and subsequently selectively triggering mobile sensing-based queuing analytics on nearby commuters; and (b) Subway Boarding Analyzer that identifies instances when passengers fail to board arriving trains, by first estimating train arrivals from temporal patterns of passenger egress at station gantries, and then using mobile sensing-based analysis of commuter movement behavior on platforms. Experiments with real-world datasets (from over 20,000 taxis and 1.7 million commuters in Singapore) show the power of this approach: the taxi service analyzer detects commuter queuing with over 90% accuracy with negligible energy overhead and estimates wait times with error margins below 15%, whereas the subway boarding analyzer can detect failed boarding events with a precision of over 90% (more than thrice what is achievable through purely mobile sensing).

abstract={This paper demonstrates a new cooperative bus location system with BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) devices and smartphones. Our idea has extended common participatory sensing systems to realize more practical sensing systems because common participatory sensing mechanisms require a participants' operation to measure some values. Our proposed system consists of a BLE devices on a bus, smartphone applications on a participants' smartphone, and a cloud service. The BLE device has a GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver and a communication function based on the BLE specification. The BLE device also activates a neighbor smartphone application by transmitting a special beacon message. Hence, the smartphone application can work and obtain the bus location from BLE device even if it was a suspended status. Additionally, it also uploads the bus location to the cloud service automatically. As a result, the proposed system can collect a bus location from BLE devices through smartphones automatically. The demonstration shows a prototype system based on the proposed idea for a bus location system. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={With more and more citizens traveling for life or work at night, there is a big gap between the demands and supplies for public transportation service in China. In this paper, we address the problem of night-bus stop planning by investigating the characteristics of taxi GPS trajectories and transactions, rather than leveraging subjective and costly surveys about citizen mobility patterns. There are two stages in our method. In the first stage, we extract the Pick-up and Drop-off Records (PDRs) from the taxi GPS trajectories and transactions for capturing citizens travel patterns at night. In the second stage, we propose DC-DBSCAN, an improved DBSCAN clustering algorithm by considering the Distance Constraint, to detect hot locations as candidate night-bus stops from the PDRs dataset. We take the service range of a bus stop into consideration, and optimize the candidates by considering the cost and convenience factors. Finally, our experiments demonstrate that our method is valid and with better performance than that of K-means. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Reliability in public transport is of great importance today. Millions of people travelling by public buses waste a lot of time waiting at bus stops. This paper focuses on presenting a solution to tackle the said problem by harnessing IoT technology stack. If the people travelling get accurate real time location of the buses along with estimate time for arrival at bus stop based on the real time traffic conditions, it will facilitate an overall increase in reliability on the public buses. The solution proposed in this paper involves using the existing internet enabled devices on the bus (like the e-ticketing system) or a simple android tablet to capture the real time location and send to the servers. Accessing this location data from servers will be facilitated by Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs which users can access through android application, SMS or web-portals. The system proposed will have distributed architecture in order to tackle high number of requests from users. Although there are existing solutions which harness the use of Global Positioning System (GPS) for bus tracking, they aren't ready to handle high demand on the backend which will exist in the near future. We have addressed this problem. The primary contribution of this paper is that it shows that a backend based on Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) instead of the traditionally used Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) based REST will be light weight, data efficient and scalable. We have proposed and implemented the backend as well as the front end required for the tracking system and presented the improvements. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Signal timing information (such as cycle length, red time, etc.) is important to bus scheduling and travel time estimation, etc. So it is of great significance to estimate the signal timing information. The existing signal timing estimation method cannot timely respond to the changes of the signal timing parameters, and it cannot well estimate the time that the vehicle arrives at the stop line. Furthermore, it assumes a uniform arrival pattern of the intersection. In order to solve the above problems, a new signal timing estimation method using bus GPS data is proposed. In order to estimate the signal timing parameters, an improved interpolation method is proposed to estimate intersection travel time of individual vehicles, and a new method of cycle breaking is proposed. Then, a method for estimating cycle boundary and cycle length using the GPS data sequence near the stop line is given. Combined with the cycle boundary estimation results, a new method for estimating red time is proposed. The simulation and field test results show that the proposed signal timing estimation method is valid and the estimation effect is obviously better than the effect of the existing method. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Public transit services should be fast and reliable. Complex road conditions, however, make them slow and fluctuate.

In order to verify the effectiveness, this article selects a bus main road on Yan'an Road between Shimen Road No. 1 Stop to Kaixuan Road Stop in Shanghai, China, as a case. Through this case study, this article verifies that the proposed bus running index can objectively and sensitively evaluate bus running conditions. Meanwhile, the result of bus timetable optimization shows good efficiency.

abstract={We consider a tradable credits scheme for binary transport games where one option is faster (or more comfortable) than the other, but its quality of service suffers when usage is high. Applications can be found in mode choice (public transit versus road transport), premium (i.e., express bus) versus ordinary public transit, and fast (e.g., high-occupancy toll, or HOT) versus regular lanes on expressways. We are motivated in particular by the choice between public transport and use of the road network as a privilege to be discouraged. In a future where GPS-based time-distance-place road charging exists, such next-generation transport management strategies become realizable as the choice to drive or not can be linked to a fixed fee toll, or indeed to a tradable credits scheme. When public transport payment uses the same smart card as the road usage fee (via tolls or tradable credits) usage of the two may be linked. In this setting, a public transport vs. road-use tradable credit scheme becomes feasible. In this case, individuals wishing to choose the faster option must obtain credits from other commuters via credit trading, rather than pay a direct toll or fee. Such a scheme creates a kind of equity, in the sense that lower-income commuters have an economic incentive to resort to the slower or less comfortable choice. We study the underlying market and its effects on individuals’ utilities; we use an atomic game framework so as to model explicitly the exchange process across users. The market we define determines the quantities of users choosing each option, as opposed to the prices themselves. Using the properties of potential games, we show that under mild assumptions, efficient Nash equilibria exist and can be reached using simple learning algorithms. We show that these equilibria can satisfy the transport authority's requirements, and thus drive the transport system to a state where a desired proportion of individuals resort to each of the two options, when the scheme's parameters are well tuned. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Provision of accurate bus arrival information is vital to passengers for reducing their anxieties and waiting times at bus stop. GPS-equipped buses can be regarded as mobile sensors probing traffic flows on road surfaces. In this paper, we present an approach that predicts bus arrival time in terms of the knowledge learned from a large number of historical bus GPS trajectories. In our approach, we build time-dependent path-section graph, where a path-section is a road segment between two adjacent bus stops, to model the properties of dynamic road networks. Then, a clustering approach is designed to estimate the distribution of travel time on each path-section in different time slots. Finally, bus arrival time is predicted based on the path-section graph and real-time GPS information. Using a real-world trajectory dataset generated by 1000 buses in a period of 2 months, a bus arrival time prediction system is built. Then we evaluate the system with extensive experiments and realistic evaluations. Experiments show that our method is close to the actual value and better than some typical algorithms. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC},

In this study, seven processes running on two servers were employed to retrieve real-time bus travelling data from the official bus information inquiry website of Suzhou, China. For data acquisition, a frequent problem encountered is the missing of bus travelling data caused by GPS signal fluctuation and network failure. In order to recover the missing data, we proposed Knearest-neighbor linear regression (KNN-LR) for data interpolation. Leave-one-out cross-validation is adapted to assess the performance of the proposed approach. It is demonstrated that the proposed KNN-LR method is robust and suitable for recovering missing data of bus trajectories in practice. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={User-generated trajectories (UGT), such as GPS footprints from wearable devices or travel records from bus companies, capture rich information of human mobility and urban dynamics in the offline world. In this paper, our objective is to enrich these raw footprints and discover the users' personal interests by utilizing the semantic information contained in the spatial-And temporal-Aware user-generated contents (STUGC) published in the online world. We design a novel probabilistic framework named CO2 to connect the offline world with the online world in order to discover the users' interests directly from their raw footprints in UGT. In particular, we first propose a latent probabilistic generative model named STLDA to infer the intention attached with each trip, and then aggregate the extracted trip intentions to discover the users' personal interests. To tackle the inherent sparsity and noisiness problems of the tags in STUGC, STLDA considers the inner correlation between tags (i.e., semantic, spatial and temporal correlation) on the topic-level. To evaluate the effectiveness of CO2, we utilize a dataset containing three months of data with 5.3 billion bus records and a Twitter dataset with 1.5 million tweets published in 6 months in Singapore as a case study. Experimental results on these two real-world datasets show that CO2 is effective in discovering user interests and improves the precision of the state-of-The-Art method by 280%. In addition, we also conduct a questionnaire survey in Singapore to evaluate the effectiveness of CO2. The results further validate the superiority of CO2. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={It is possible to quantify individual motion trajectories with the rapid development of sensor applications such as mobile positioning and wireless communication, and the characteristics like a large number, long time series and fine spatiotemporal granularity of GPS location data, bus IC data, and mobile phone data provide a hopeful premise for the study of human behavior. Based on a large amount of mobile information equipment, the effective mining of these data and the use of reasonable processing methods can make the processing results closer to reflect the actual human behavior patterns, and better serve the real traffic life. In this paper, by discussing the results of previous studies on human mobility, spatial interpolation method is used to discrete bus passenger flow obtained from big data of Beijing bus IC card into the continues area distribution, and we analyze the changed trend of passenger flow in Beijing of the whole day by utilizing the Spatial-temporal method. To a certain extent, the analysis of urban bus passenger distribution studied from Beijing bus IC data can understand the rules of human behavior and provide reliable data guidance for reasonable decision-making on Beijing passenger traffic planning, such like solving problem effectively that the number of bus passenger and the number of bus station does not match. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York},

These systems typically require real-time monitoring of traffic variations. We provide a personalized approach where in a world of pervasive smart phone use, users may take advantage of sensor data to learn and personalize their bus routes, and alert them on time when a bus stop is approaching. We accomplish this through the development and implementation of two algorithms: 1) turn detection using on-board compass sensor of a smart phone, and 2) characterizing road segments in terms of turns and thereby predicting approaching bus stops. We conduct field experiments on a route with four selected bus stops in the town of Chapel Hill. Results show that the accuracy of turn detection and detection of approaching bus stops are 95.7% and 83%, respectively. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={New ideas, technologies and architectural concepts are emerging with the potential to reshape the space enterprise. One of those new architectural concepts is the idea that rather than aggregating payloads onto large very high performance buses, space architectures should be disaggregated with smaller numbers of payloads (as small as one) per bus and the space capabilities spread across a correspondingly larger number of systems. The primary rationale is increased survivability and resilience. The concept of disaggregation is examined from an acquisition cost perspective. A mixed system dynamics and trade space exploration model is developed to look at long-term trends in the space acquisition business. The model is used to examine the question of how different disaggregated GPS architectures compare in cost to the well-known current GPS architecture. A generation-over-generation examination of policy choices is made possible through the application of soft systems modeling of experience and learning effects. The assumptions that are allowed to vary are: design lives, production quantities, non-recurring engineering and time between generations. The model shows that there is always a premium in the first generation to be paid to disaggregate the GPS payloads. However, it is possible to construct survivable architectures where the premium after two generations is relatively low. © 2017 IAA},

abstract={The aim of the paper is to evaluate the impacts of bus lane on bus travel time reliability. The data used are the Geographic Positioning System (GPS) data of two bus lines running parallel streets in Shenzhen, China, one of which is a bus lane and the other is a regular lane. Two linear regression models are developed to evaluate the influence of bus lane which has a separated right of way. Other factors including running direction, day of week, time of day, dwell time, and delay at the start point are also considered in the model. Without published time tables, coefficient of variance (CV) of travel time is employed to explore the impacts of bus lane. The results indicate that bus lane can save 22.0% of travel time, reduce 11.5% of the CV of travel time, and decrease the variance of headway by 17.4%. The analysis on bus travel time reliability could help operators and drivers improve the quality of transit service. It also sheds light on how to assess the effectiveness of bus lane for transit planners and service operators. Copyright © 2017 Editorial Department of Journal of Donghua University.

abstract={We study the problem of identifying vehicle trajectories from the sequences of noisy geospatial-temporal datasets. Nowadays we witness the accumulation of vehicle trajectory datasets in the form of the sequences of GPS points. However, in many cases the sequences of GPS points are sparse and noisy so that identifying the actual trajectories of vehicles is hard. Although there are many advanced map-matching techniques claiming to achieve high accuracy to deal with the problem, only few public datasets that come with ground truth trajectories for supporting the claims. On the other hand, some cities are releasing their bus datasets for real-time monitoring and analytics. Since buses are expected to run on predefined routes, such datasets are highly valuable for map-matching and other pattern recognition applications. Nevertheless, some buses in reality appear not following their predefined routes and behave anomalously. We propose a simple and robust technique based on the combination of map-matching, bag-of-roads, and dimensionality reduction for their route identification. Experiments on datasets of buses in the city of Rio de Janeiro confirm the high accuracy of our method. © 2016 IEEE.},

Besides the major goal of carrying passengers around, providing a comfortable travel experience for passengers is also a key business consideration. To provide a comfortable travel experience, effective bus scheduling is essential. Traditional approaches are based on fixed timetables. The wide adoptions of smart card fare collection systems and GPS tracing systems in public transportation provide new opportunities for using the data-driven approaches to fit the demand of passengers. In this paper, we associate these two independent data sets to derive the passengers' origin and destination. As the data are real time, we build a system to forecast the passenger flow in real time.

abstract={GPS-fitted buses operating in bus rapid transit systems (BRTS) of India make it easier to collect a wealth of travel-time data from them. This article evaluates the operational performance of BRTS routes based on GPS data. First, various simplified statistical range parameters, viz. coefficient of variation percentile travel time, travel-time distributions, etc. are selected for route evaluation. Then, two bus routes of the Ahmedabad BRTS are selected as case study to develop and validate a methodology for evaluating the performance of these routes based on selected parameters. Weekday bus travel-time data for one direction accounting for 2124 bus trips are used in the study. The study then compares travel-time reliability-based performance of a BRT and a non-BRT route. Further, the study proposes an approach to measure a shift in BRTS network level of service based on two indices - average travel time per kilometre, and travel-time coefficient of variation. A left shift in cumulative plot indicates an improvement in the BRTS network level of service in the year 2016 compared to 2013.},

abstract={The precise spatio-temporal position data of vehicles is useful for most studies, such as wireless link lifetime and node degree in vehicular ad hoc networks. However, due to the system errors and random errors, the existing Global Positioning System (GPS) only provides the positional accuracy about 10m or even worse. In this paper, to address the issue of positional accuracy, a Clustering and Approximating (C-A) algorithm is proposed. We first divide each road into several small parts which are described by linear functions. Then a linear regression algorithm is utilized to approximate traces under system errors, which is reliable for reducing GPS errors. Particularly, when two roads are very close, GPS points may be mapped on adjacent roads. A clustering algorithm is taken to separate GPS points and their positions are revised by the iterative utilization of the linear regression algorithm. In the end, the method mentioned above smoothes raw GPS data of buses in Taiwan to make it available for further researches. Compared with existing methods, the method described in this paper characterized with low cost and high reliability in different situations. Besides, its simple model will make the process of revising data more convenient. © 2016 IEEE.},

In a first step, subway trips were detected by applying a GPS/geographic information system (GIS) algorithm and a multinomial logit model. A comparison of the identification results reveals that the GPS/GIS method provides higher accuracy. Then, the modes of walking, bicycle, car and bus were determined using a nested logit model. The combined success rate of the hybrid procedure was 86%. These findings can be used to identify travel modes based on GPS survey data, which will significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of travel surveys and data analysis. By providing crucial travel information, the results also contribute to modeling and analyzing travel behaviors and are readily applicable to a wide range of transportation practices. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={One of methods to improve the convenience and quality of service provided by bus service operators is to implement a bus location system capable of providing positional and operation related information to the users. We have previously proposed and implemented a novel global positioning system (GPS)-based bus location system using wireless sensor networks interspersed in the city, which does therefore not entail any communication costs. In this paper, we propose a new bus location method that does not use GPS positioning, and thus reduces the manufacturing cost of the transceivers mounted on community buses. We develop prototype devices and conduct an on-road demonstration experiment, confirming that the required bus location information can be estimated with sufficient accuracy. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={Bus travel time is an important source of data for time of day partition of the bus route. However, in practice, a bus driver may deliberately speed up or slow down on route so as to follow the predetermined timetable. The raw GPS data collected by the GPS device equipped on the bus, as a result, cannot reflect its real operating conditions. To address this concern, this study first develops a method to identify whether there is deliberate speed-up or slow-down movement of a bus. Building upon the relationships between the intersection delay, link travel time, and traffic flow, a recovery method is established for calculating the real bus travel time. Using the dwell time at each stop and the recovered travel time between each of them as the division indexes, a sequential clustering-based time of day partition method is proposed. The effectiveness of the developed method is demonstrated using the data of bus route 63 in Harbin, China. Results show that the partition method can help bus enterprises to design reasonable time of day intervals and significantly improve their level of service. © 2017 Jian Wang and Yang Cao.},

abstract={The increasing number of road accidents year after year in India is a major concern to the government as the economic losses due to death and disabilities caused by accidents are very large. Excessive speed is one of the major causes of accidents in national and state highways and rash driving of private buses in order to maintain their schedule times lead to accidents many times. A study was carried out to analyze the speed characteristics of both private and government buses in two popular bus routes in Vellore and Tiruvannamalai districts of Tamil Nadu, namely Vellore -Arani and Vellore -Tiruvannamalai routes using handheld Global Positioning System (GPS) instruments. A total of 9 trips were collected, with six trips in private buses and three trips in government buses during morning peak hours. The analysis of GPS data revealed that in both the routes, at many stretches, private buses crosses the speed limit of 80 km/hr. However in government buses, the maximum recorded speed is only 76 km/hr. It was found that in Vellore -Arani route, the private buses recorded a maximum speed of 95 km/hr in a stretch between Pudupalayam koot road and Kunnathur. Similarly in Vellore -Tiruvannamalai route, private buses travel as high as 98 km/hr between Santhavasal and Polur. In order to adhere to the schedule times, the private buses travel at very high speeds and whenever there is a delay along the route, they make up for it by increasing their speed on the highway and this phenomenon may lead to accidents. Hence the traffic police and highways department should ensure the provision of proper speed control measures to ensure the safe journey in the routes analyzed. © IAEME Publication.},

This work proposes a new model of activity recognition in GPS captured data and enriched with POIs (Points Of Interest) and user profile. The experiment was performed by 10 volunteers collecting data for 10 days. The model aims to recognize 13 different activities, divided into stop activities (Bank, breakfast, dining, lunch, praying, recreation, shopping, studying, waiting transport and working) and moves activities (in a car, on a bus and walking). The model was tested and compared to J48, SVM, ANN and RF algorithms, and obtained 97.4% hits. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={At present, our country is facing the problems of resource shortage, such as the air pollution, the traffic congestion and the population aging, which have seriously affected the sustainable development of the city. Human movement and the movement of vehicles are reflecting the changes of urban environment. The analysis of moving objects historical trajectory big data is the necessary means to build a smart city. Due to the Global Positioning System (GPS) data recording the taxi's and the bus's driving time and location, the GPS-equipped taxi can be regarded as the detector of an urban transport system. The data acquisition in the traffic system is a geometric trend growth, so it is urgent to build a platform that can handle big data processing. The GPS trajectory big data has the characteristic of strong real-time and great changes. The use of big data cloud platform data storage can greatly reduce the cost of data storage, and at the same time improve the security of data storage. This paper deeply analyses the application requirements of the intelligent traffic trajectory big data processing platform and studies the mining method to do with the GPS trajectory big data. Through the simulation we can grasp the distribution characteristic of GPS trajectory big data. © 2017 IOS Press and the authors.},

abstract={Understanding meaningful information such as transportation mode (e.g., walking, bus) from Global Positioning System (GPS) data has great advantages in urban management and environmental protection. However, the urban traffic environment has evolved from “data poor” to “data rich”, resulting in the decline in the accuracy of transportation mode detection results. In this paper, an enhanced approach for effectively detecting transportation mode with a detection model and correction method from GPS data is proposed. Specifically, we make the following contributions. First, a trajectory segmentation method is proposed to detect single-mode segments. Secondly, a Random Forest (RF)-based detection model containing several new features is introduced to enhance discrimination. Finally, a correction method is designed to improve the detection performance, which is based on the mode probability of the current segment and its adjacent segments. The results of our detection model and correction method outperform state-of-the-art research in transportation mode detection. © 2017, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={With the development of in-vehicle data collection devices, GPS trajectory has become a priority source to identify traffic congestion and understand the operational states of road network in recent years. This study aims to investigate the relationship between traffic congestion and built environment, including traffic-related factors and land use. Fuzzy C-means clustering was used to conduct an exhaustive study on the 24-hour congestion pattern of road segments in an urban area, so that the spatial autoregressive moving average model (SARMA) could be introduced to analyze the output from the clustering analysis to establish the relationship between built environment and the 24-hour congestion pattern. The clustering result classified the road segments into four congestion levels, while the regression explained the impact of 12 traffic-related factors and land-use factors on the road congestion pattern. The continuous congestion was found to mainly occur in the city center, and the factors, such as road type, bus station in the vicinity, ramp nearby, commercial land use, and so on, had large impacts on congestion formation. The Fuzzy C-means clustering is proposed to be combined with quantitative spatial regression, and the overall evaluation process will assist to assess the spatial-temporal levels of service regarding traffic from the congestion perspective. © 2017 Kaisheng Zhang, Daniel(Jian) Sun, Suwan Shen & Yi Zhu.},
